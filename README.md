## About 
As seen, This Hogwarts contract allows the owner to mint non-fungible tokens representing the four Hogwarts houses. The NFTs are stored on IPFS and are associated with a specific house. The contract also enforces a custom transfer condition where transfers are only allowed from or to the zero address, indicating that the tokens are soulbound within the Hogwarts context.
